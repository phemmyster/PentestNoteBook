</head><body>By SecurityTube, i think they are now known as pentester academy or so<br/>
basically windows xp and parrot os ( they used backtrack)<br/>
<br/>
the windows xp shld be vulnerable to RPC DCOM (MSO3_026) and netapi (MSO8_067) // ow do i knw dt?<br/>
<br/>
important terms<br/>
1. vulnerability - weakness which enable an attack to be able to break into a computer<br/>
2. exploit - the code that enable the attack to use the vulnerability.<br/>
3. payload - &nbsp;actual code that runs on the system after exploitation.<br/>
<br/>
&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;<br/>
<br/>
so instead of download and compling each exploit u jux use metasploit<br/>
cuz it already have a lot of expoit provided in it<br/>
